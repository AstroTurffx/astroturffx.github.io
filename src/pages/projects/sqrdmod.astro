        <p>
            SQRD Mod is a minecraft mod I devloped for a private mincraft server and was a early and big step of my programming journey,
            I learned to take apart source code and that there isn't tutorials for everything. The members of the server, including me,
            threw some ideas together, taking in the fact a couple of friends streaming gameplay of the server. My first attempt of this
            project was made with the
            <a href="https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forge Mod Loader</a>
            due to my lack of programming skills at the time, I stopped completely. I had come to the part of the development where I had
            to save custom item data, using Forge Capabillities, which was extremely hard to understand at the time. While researching for
            a solution I came accross another mod loader called <a href="https://fabricmc.net/" target="_blank" >Fabric</a>.
